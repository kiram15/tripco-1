# TripCo

This semester was an "internship at TripCo, a startup travel planning company." In a team of 4 people, we built an application using SCRUM based development to support the business. From the begining to the end of the semester, the project evolved from:
* reading data from a CSV file to interacting with a database.
* creating an iterinerary from computing the mileage between destinations, to ordering the destinations for the most efficient trip.
* a JSON version of the itinerary to a server that packaged the information needed by the to render the itinerary and deliver it.
* a client that just rendered the information it was provided, to an interactive single page application.
